Transmission Lines and Networks by Umesh Sinha is a well-written and well-organized book that covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of transmission lines and networks. The book is divided into 12 chapters, each of which contains several solved examples, unsolved problems, review questions, and objective questions. The book also has appendices that provide useful information on units, symbols, constants, formulas, and tables.
 
The book starts with an introduction to transmission lines and their parameters, such as resistance, inductance, capacitance, conductance, characteristic impedance, propagation constant, reflection coefficient, standing wave ratio, and power factor. It then explains the different types of transmission lines, such as open and short-circuited lines, line with any termination, power lines (low frequency lines), telegraph and telephone lines (medium frequency lines), and ultra-high frequency lines (microwave lines). It also discusses the methods of analyzing transmission lines, such as lumped parameter method, distributed parameter method, graphical method (Smith chart), and numerical method (transmission line equations).
