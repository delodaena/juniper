## What is CD Key 13?
 
A CD key is a unique code that is used to activate and register a game. It usually consists of 20 alphanumeric characters, such as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. CD key 13 is a specific type of CD key that works for Call of Duty 1 multiplayer version 1.3. Version 1.3 is an older patch that was released in 2004 and added some new features and fixes to the game. Some players prefer to play on version 1.3 because it has more servers and less bugs than newer versions.
 
## How to Get CD Key 13?
 
If you own a physical copy of Call of Duty 1, you can find your CD key on the back of the manual or on the disc case. However, if you don't have a physical copy or you lost your CD key, you can generate one online using a website like [codkey](https://codkey). This website will generate a random CD key that works for Call of Duty 1 multiplayer version 1.3. You can also use this website to generate CD keys for other versions of the game, such as 1.1 or 1.5.
 
## How to Use CD Key 13?
 
To use your CD key 13, you need to install Call of Duty 1 multiplayer version 1.3 on your computer. You can download the game client and the patch from various sources online, such as [this guide](https://cod.pm/guide/e981a4/installing-call-of-duty-1-game-client-or-patches). After you download and extract the game files, you need to edit or create a file called codkey in the main folder of the game. This file should contain your CD key 13 as a single line of text, like this:

    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX // generated by CoD, do not modify
    // Do not give this file to ANYONE.
    // Infinity Ward and Activision will NOT ask you to send this file to them.

Save the file and run CoDMP.exe to start the game. You should be able to join any server that runs on version 1.3 and enjoy playing Call of Duty 1 multiplayer with your CD key 13.

## How to Update to Version 1.5?
 
If you want to play on newer servers that run on version 1.5, you need to update your game to the latest patch. Version 1.5 is the final patch that was released in 2006 and added some new maps and features to the game. However, you cannot use your CD key 13 for version 1.5, as it is only compatible with version 1.3. You need to get a new CD key that works for version 1.5.
 
To update your game to version 1.5, you need to download and install the patch from [this link](https://www.fileplanet.com/archive/p-16203/Call-of-Duty-v1-5-Patch). After you install the patch, you need to edit your Windows registry and add your CD key for version 1.5. You can download and edit a .reg file according to your system from [this guide](https://cod.pm/guide/e981a4/installing-call-of-duty-1-game-client-or-patches). The .reg file should look something like this:

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Activision\Call of Duty]
    "InstallPath"="C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Activision\\Call of Duty\\"
    "InstallDrive"="C:"
    "Language"="1"
    "pb"="1"
    "Version"="1.5"
    "codkey"="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

Replace the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your CD key for version 1.5 and save the file. Double-click the file to add it to your registry. You should now be able to play Call of Duty 1 multiplayer on version 1.5 with your new CD key.

- Choose your weapon wisely. Different weapons have different advantages and disadvantages in terms of damage, accuracy, fire rate, recoil, and ammo capacity. Experiment with different weapons and find the ones that suit your playstyle and the map you are playing on.
- Use cover and movement. Don't stand still in the open or you will be an easy target for snipers and grenades. Use walls, buildings, trees, and other objects as cover and move from cover to cover when advancing or retreating. Also, use crouching and prone positions to reduce your visibility and increase your accuracy.
- Communicate and cooperate with your team. Call of Duty 1 multiplayer is a team-based game that requires coordination and teamwork to win. Use voice chat or text chat to communicate with your teammates and share information about enemy locations, objectives, strategies, and requests for backup or ammo. Also, follow your team leader's orders and stick together with your squad.
- Learn the maps and modes. Call of Duty 1 multiplayer has various maps and modes that offer different gameplay experiences and challenges. Learn the layout of each map and the objectives of each mode and adapt your tactics accordingly. Also, learn the spawn points, choke points, sniping spots, and hidden paths of each map and use them to your advantage.
- Have fun and be respectful. Call of Duty 1 multiplayer is a game that is meant to be enjoyed by everyone who plays it. Don't cheat, hack, glitch, or exploit the game in any way that gives you an unfair advantage or ruins the fun for others. Also, don't be toxic, rude, or abusive to other players or servers in voice chat or text chat. Be respectful, friendly, and helpful to everyone you encounter in the game.
